\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Our initial goal was to evaluate the existing literature for tomographic
DOAS, assessing the technologic status of this analytical technique. We
have started by devising a search protocol and applying it to a set of
5 electronic libraries which were previously determined to be relevant.

This approach has rendered 732 articles, of which 724 were eliminated
through the application of our selection criteria (inclusion and
exclusion). We have thus ended with 8 articles, then evaluated with
regard to the 3 aspects that we have set out to assess: equipment,
algorithm and software used.

Although we have to recognise that we have a very low number of selected
articles, we believe that they are representative of the current
literature, since tomographic DOAS is a relatively new technique, which
has not yet been thoroughly researched.

Our results suggest that there is a great prevalence of active DOAS for
tomographic reconstruction. We have not found a single example of
passive DOAS in our search. In addition, we also detected that despite
being similar in many ways, there is still no uniformly designed
equipment, software or geometry for DOAS tomography.
