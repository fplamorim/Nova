\subsection{Discretisation}%
\label{sub:discretisation}

Discretisation is the process by which the \gls{ROI} is digitised into a
computational platform. There are several algorithms designed for this
effect that are available in the literature. One of the easiest to
implement that is also adequate to this application (unsurprisingly)
comes from the medical imaging field. It was published in 1985 by Robert
Siddon~\cite{siddon1985}
