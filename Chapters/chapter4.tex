\section{Aimed contribution}%
\label{sec:aimed_contribution}

This work aims to answer its main \gls{RQ} by following and pursuing the
proposed hypothesis (see Section~\ref{sec:hypothesis_and_approach}). In
doing so, I will contribute with a commercially viable (from a technical
perspective) atmospheric monitoring system based on DOAS, capable of not
only measuring pollutant contamination but also mapping their
concentration in a given geographic region. This will generate several
intermediate steps, which are themselves smaller contributions:

The first intermediate step will be the development of a tomographic
strategy. This will of course include the selection of a sampling
geometry (consider the ones presented in
Section~\ref{sec:tomographic_algorithms_and_reconstruction_techniques}),
but also the positioning of "sources and sensors" within the selected
geometry. Since the system is designed to be a passive DOAS device (see
Section~\ref{sec:doas}), careful consideration must be taken in this
respect. Spectral acquisition must be done in a way that allows
tomographic reconstruction, but also respecting limitations and
particularities that come from working with solar light. This step
corresponds to answering the first secondary Research Question (see
Table~\ref{tab:sec_RQ}).

The next step will be to write a simulation tool for the tomographic
procedure. The idea is for this tool to encompass the acquisition
strategy that was defined in the previous step, in order to replicate
the whole measurement process and then perform the reconstruction using
one or more algorithms. The simulation tool has several functions. For
one, it allows the fine-tuning of the approaches without having to
expend any resources in purchasing material. Besides this, it also gives
gives researchers the chance to experiment with different algorithms.
The routine will be divided into two modules. The first module computes
the projections for a given phantom, and the second performs the
reconstruction with the projection data. The point is that one can write
a tomographic reconstruction routine and plug it to the projection
computation module, without any interference from one to the other. 

Finally we reach the instrumentation definition phase. In this stage, I
will have to select the optical components necessary to build this
system, including telescope, spectrometer and all the connection
components. In order to maintain this system as small as possible, I
will try to avoid using optical fibers, thus minimizing energy loss
between telescope and spectrometer. In this stage, I will also have to
design a mechanical support that allows a drone to be equipped with the
optical system, respecting all positioning and pointing requirements
that such a device must entail.

\section{Detailed work plan and scheduling}%
\label{sec:detailed_work_plan_and_scheduling}

In this section, I will present the work plan that was defined and is
being followed while conducting the work of the proposed thesis.I will
start by Figure~\ref{fig:low_res_gantt}, a low resolution Gantt chart.
This chart is comprised of the more high level tasks, which coarsely
follow the previously detailed approaches and contribution goals
(see~\ref{sec:aimed_contribution}
and~\ref{sec:hypothesis_and_approach}). We can see that there are two
main milestones, which correspond to the publication moments. The first
of these milestones was reached in 2017, with the publication
of~\cite{ValentedeAlmeida2017}.

Figure~\ref{fig:task1}, Figure~\ref{fig:task2}, Figure~\ref{fig:task3}
and Figure~\ref{fig:task4} are the same Gantt chart presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:low_res_gantt}, but they are \emph{zoomed in} to each
task of the project.
