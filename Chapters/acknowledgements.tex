I am writing these lines sometime in 2019. It is hard to contemplate
that almost 4 years have come and gone since I started this gigantic
endeavour. It took a lot of work (and will still take a lot more because
I am not done writing this!), a lot of dedication, patience and
perseverance, but it is finally done. Here is my PhD thesis, the
culmination of my work for the past 4 years. I hope anyone who is
reading enjoys doing so, or if not, I hope that at least he finds what
he was looking for.

I call it my work, and indeed it is, but I find it difficult to believe
that I would be able to do it without the help of the people and
institutions I acknowledge in this section. Know that I am deeply
grateful, and will forever remain so.

The first I have to thank is my advisor, Professor Pedro Vieira, with
whom I have worked with for the better part of 10 years, and who has
become one of the people to which I am closer,

To the institutions: 






The acknowledgements. You are free to write this section at your own will.  However, usually it starts with the institutional acknowledgements (adviser, institution, grants, workmates, \ldots) and then comes the personal acknowledgements (friends, family, \ldots).
