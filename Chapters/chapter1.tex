\section{Background and Motivation}%
\label{sec:bg_and_motivation}

\subsection{Background}%
\label{sub:background}

The idea behind this thesis was born in 2015, at NGNS-IS (a Portuguese
tech startup). At the time, the company's flagship product was the
Forest Fire Finder (\gls{FFF}), which was a forest fire detection system
that performed a spectroscopical analysis of the atmosphere and then,
through some Machine Learning (\gls{ML}) techniques, could detect the
presence of a smoke column above the horizon and alert the operators.

The growing importance of Air Pollution (\gls{AP}) in today's society,
and the fact that the system was already scanning the atmosphere for
some chemical components originated and motivated the idea behind this
thesis. Although \gls{FFF} was already a spectroscopic system, it was
constructed to operate in remote and inhospitable locations, and its
design had had no spatial constraints into account. In addition, the
system scanning method (depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:fff_scanning}) meant
that it was not appropriate for pollution measurement, as it could only
detect a mean pollutant column density for each spectrum it took. A
truly useful monitoring tool would be able to map these pollutants
concentration, thus retrieving the same kind of information as a network
of in-situ electro-chemical sensors.

This ambition also brought novelty to the project, since to the best of
the team's knowledge, a similar system had not yet been developed, a
situation that has remained the same up to the current days.

\subsection{The Problem}%
\label{sub:the_problem}

Air Pollution (\gls{AP}) is one of the grave concerns of modern day
western society, with many decades worth of research proving that it can
have a pronounced negative effect on human, animal and plant life, as
shown in Section~\ref{sec:theoretical_background}. On humans, it has
been shown to significantly increase risk of cardiovascular, pulmonary
and even neuropsychiatric diseases~\cite{Carugno2016, Ghorani-Azam2016,
Kampa2008}. Its implications on ecosystems are remarkably complex and
difficult to quantify, but nonetheless extremely important, and have a
huge impact on biodiversity~\cite{Lovett2009}.

Knowing all this brings us the responsibility of at least trying to
mitigate some of these adverse consequences of the spectacular progress
that we have achieved in the few last centuries. But we cannot act
unless we also know what we must do; and to know this, we must have
measurements.

\subsection{Objectives}%
\label{sub:objectives}

The overarching goal of this thesis was to theorize and design a
bidimensional mapping tool for trace atmospheric pollutants such as
NO$_x$ and SO$_x$, using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy
(\gls{DOAS}) as the measurement technique. During the research, several
"micro-objectives" appeared regularly. Some were kept and incorporated
in the workplan, others discarded after initial exploration. The main
secondary objectives, which had a very heavy influence over the adopted
methods, were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To use a tomographic approach for the mapping procedure;
    \item To use a single collection point, minimizing material costs
        for the technology.
\end{itemize}

% This thesis is thus subject to the Research Question (\gls{RQ}):
% \textbf{How to design a single collection, tomographic mapping, DOAS
% atmospheric monitoring system?}

% \subsection{Air Pollution}%
% \label{ssub:air_pollution}

% Air Pollution (\gls{AP}) is a very important topic of discussion in the
% current days, with scientists and researchers around the globe being
% very well aware of the potential effects it can have on the health of
% individuals and populations across all ecosystems. Not to mention its
% implications on climate change, which are generally regarded as one of
% the capital threats to life on Earth's survival (on par with a nuclear
% apocalypse). Defining \gls{AP} can be a challenge. In fact, its effects
% and presence is so all-encompassing, that it would be fair to say that
% its definition changes with the angle with which one looks upon it.
% Nonetheless, it is important to at least try to define it, in order to
% approach it in some way~\cite{Lovett2009, Ghorani-Azam2016}.

% The United States Environmental Protection Agency (\Gls{EPA}) defined
% Air Pollution (\Gls{AP}) as "\textit{the presence of contaminants or
%     pollutant substances in the air that interfere with human health or
%     welfare, or produce other harmful environmental
% effects}"~\cite{Vallero2014}. This is (perhaps intentionally) a very
% broad definition, too broad to avoid vagueness. It does introduce a key
% concept: the term \emph{pollutant}, which needs be discussed in order
% to complete the definition above.

% It would be very hard to find someone who did not have an almost
% instinctive idea of what a pollutant is. We know something is amiss when
% we notice our air is full of smoke or smells strange, but our senses are
% not enough. There are many chemical components that are untraceable by
% unaided humans, and some that are only detected by our noses and eyes at
% concentration levels which are above the threshold where they can damage
% our health. This makes the task of separating pollutants from
% non-pollutants a non-trivial one. If we cannot rely solely on our senses
% to detect them, then it is up to the scientists and engineers to create
% methods that allow us to do so. Whats more, we must also rely on them to
% understand how can a normally harmless substance be a pollutant,
% depending on the circumstance. For instance, nitrous compounds are
% traditionally beneficial to the soils and cultures, but they can and do
% cause pulmonary and  cardiovascular complications in
% humans~\cite{Kampa2008, Ghorani-Azam2016, Carugno2016}.

% Context matters to pollutants. The toxic nature of a certain chemical
% only is revealed when someone or something gets exposed to it. Even
% then, there are exposure levels which do not bear any effects, good or
% bad. At these levels, a pollutant is but an impurity. There too many
% potential pollutants in our modern day world to list here, but the World
% Health Organization (\gls{WHO}) states that there are six major air
% pollutants:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Particle Matter (\gls{PM});
%     \item Ground level ozone (O$_3$);
%     \item Carbon monoxide (CO);
%     \item Sulfur Oxides (SO$_x$);
%     \item Nitrous Oxides (NO$_x$);
%     \item Lead (Pb).
% \end{itemize}

% Exposure to these pollutants have different effects on humans, ranging in
% seriousness from skin irritation to neuropsychiatric complications,
% depending on dose and on the time the exposure lasts. In the next
% subsections, I will address each of the major pollutants enumerated and
% briefly describe the physiological mechanisms behind their toxicity.
