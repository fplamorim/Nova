abstract = {We apply a novel experimental procedure for the rapid measurement of the average volume mixing ratios (VMRs) and horizontal distributions of trace gases such as NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the boundary layer, which was recently suggested by Sinreich et al. (2013). The method is based on two-dimensional scanning multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS). It makes use of two facts (Sinreich et al., 2013): first, the light path for observations at 1° elevation angle traverses mainly air masses located close to the ground (typically 4. Thus, the average value of the trace gas VMR in the atmospheric layer between the surface and the particular altitude, for which this observation was sensitive, can be calculated. Compared to the originally proposed method, we introduce several important modifications and improvements: We apply the method only to measurements at 1° elevation angle (besides zenith view), for which the uncertainties of the retrieved values of the VMRs and surface extinctions are especially small. Using only 1° elevation angle for off-axis observation also allows an increased temporal resolution. We determine (and apply) correction factors (and their uncertainties) directly as function of the measured O4 absorption. Finally, the method is extended to trace gases analysed at other wavelengths and also to the retrieval of aerosol extinction. Depending on atmospheric visibility, the typical uncertainty of the results ranges from about 20{\%} to 30{\%}. We apply the rapid method to observations of a newly-developed ground-based multifunctional passive differential optical absorption spectroscopy (GM-DOAS) instrument in the north-west outskirts near Hefei in China. We report NO2, SO2, and HCHO VMRs and aerosol extinction for four azimuth angles and compare these results with those from simultaneous long-path DOAS observations. Good agreement is found (squares of the correlation coefficients for NO2, SO2, and HCHO were 0.92, 0.85, and 0.60, respectively), verifying the reliability of this novel method. Similar agreement is found for the comparison of the aerosol extinction with results from visibility meters. Future studies may conduct measurements using a larger number of azimuth angles to increase the spatial resolution.},

abstract = {In many investigations of tropospheric chemistry information about the two dimensional distribution of trace gases on a small scale (e.g. tens to hundreds of meters) is highly desirable. An airborne instrument based on imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy has been built to map the 2-D distribution of a series of relevant trace gases including NO2, HCHO, C2H2O2, H2O, O4, SO 2, and BrO on a scale of 100 m. Here we report on the first tests of the novel aircraft instrument over the industrialised South African Highveld, where large variations in NO2 column densities in the immediate vicinity of several sources e.g. power plants or steel works, were measured. The observed patterns in the trace gas distribution are interpreted with respect to flux estimates, and it is seen that the fine resolution of the measurements allows separate sources in close proximity to one another to be distinguished.},

@article{Rutten2004,
abstract = {In this paper we revisit observational data concerning RR Lyrae stars in Galactic globular clusters, presenting frequency histograms of fundamentalized periods for the 32 clusters having more than 12 pulsators with well recognized period and pulsation mode. One finds that the range of fundamentalized periods covered by the variables in a given cluster remains fairly constant in varying the cluster metallicity all over the metallicity range spanned by the cluster sample, with the only two exceptions given by M 15 and NGC 6441. We conclude that the width in temperature of the RR Lyrae instability strip appears largely independent of the cluster metallicity. At the same time, it appears that the fundamentalized periods are not affected by the predicted variation of pulsators luminosity with metal abundance, indicating the occurrence of a correlated variation in the pulsator mass. We discuss mean periods in a selected sample of statistically significant ``RR rich" clusters with no less than 10 RRab and 5 RRc variables. One finds a clear evidence for the well known Oosterhoff dichotomy in the mean period {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} of ab-type variables, together with a similarly clear evidence for a constancy of the mean fundamentalized period {\textless}Pf{\textgreater} in passing from Oosterhoff type II to type I clusters. On this basis, the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is discussed, presenting evidence against a strong dependence of the RR Lyrae luminosity on the metal content. On the contrary, i) the continuity of the mean fundamentalized period, ii) the period frequency histograms in the two prototypes M 3 (type I) and M 15 (type II), iii) the relative abundance of first overtone pulsators, and iv) the observed difference between mean fundamental {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} and fundamentalized periods {\textless}Pf{\textgreater}, all agree in suggesting the dominant occurrence of a variation in the pulsation mode in a middle region of the instability strip (the ``OR" zone), where variables of Oosterhoff type I and type II clusters are pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode, respectively.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spec- troscopy (MAX-DOAS) in the atmosphere is a novel mea- surement technique that represents a significant advance on the well-established zenith scattered sunlight DOAS instru- ments which are mainly sensitive to stratospheric absorbers. MAX-DOAS utilizes scattered sunlight received from mul- tiple viewing directions. The spatial distribution of various trace gases close to the instrument can be derived by combin- ing several viewing directions. Ground based MAX-DOAS is highly sensitive to absorbers in the lowest few kilome- tres of the atmosphere and vertical profile information can be retrieved by combining the measurements with Radia- tive Transfer Model (RTM) calculations. The potential of the technique for a wide variety of studies of tropospheric trace species and its (few) limitations are discussed. AMonte Carlo RTM is applied to calculate Airmass Factors (AMF) for the various viewing geometries ofMAX-DOAS. Airmass Factors can be used to quantify the light path length within the absorber layers. The airmass factor dependencies on the viewing direction and the influence of several parameters (trace gas profile, ground albedo, aerosol profile and type, solar zenith and azimuth angles) are investigated. In addition we give a brief description of the instrumental MAX-DOAS systems realised and deployed so far. The results of the RTM studies are compared to several examples of recent MAX- DOAS field experiments and an outlook for future possible applications is given.},

abstract = {In this study we validate the two-dimensional long path DOAS tomography measurement technique by means of an indoor experiment with well-known concentration distributions. The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv. Larger plumes can be measured with higher precision.},

@article{Wagner2007,
abstract = {The results of a comparison exercise of radiative transfer models (RTM) of various international research groups for Multiple AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) viewing geometry are presented. Besides the assessment of the agreement between the different models, a second focus of the comparison was the systematic investigation of the sensitivity of the MAX-DOAS technique under various viewing geometries and aerosol conditions. In contrast to previous comparison exercises, box-air-mass-factors (box-AMFs) for different atmospheric height layers were modelled, which describe the sensitivity of the measurements as a function of altitude. In addition, radiances were calculated allowing the identification of potential errors, which might be overlooked if only AMFs are compared. Accurate modelling of radiances is also a prerequisite for the correct interpretation of satellite observations, for which the received radiance can strongly vary across the large ground pixels, and might be also important for the retrieval of aerosol properties as a future application of MAX-DOAS. The comparison exercises included different wavelengths and atmospheric scenarios ( with and without aerosols). The strong and systematic influence of aerosol scattering indicates that from MAX-DOAS observations also information on atmospheric aerosols can be retrieved. During the various iterations of the exercises, the results from all models showed a substantial convergence, and the final data sets agreed for most cases within about 5{\%}. Larger deviations were found for cases with low atmospheric optical depth, for which the photon path lengths along the line of sight of the instrument can become very large. The differences occurred between models including full spherical geometry and those using only plane parallel approximation indicating that the correct treatment of the Earth's sphericity becomes indispensable. The modelled box-AMFs constitute an universal data base for the calculation of arbitrary ( total) AMFs by simple convolution with a given trace gas concentration profile. Together with the modelled radiances and the specified settings for the various exercises, they can serve as test cases for future RTM developments.},

abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for the retrieval of the vertical profile of atmospheric gas pollutants in the boundary layer from ground based remote sensing measurements. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) slant column amounts have been obtained with the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique used in the multiple axis configuration (the so called MAX-DOAS). The measurements have been carried out in the Presidential Estate at Castel Porziano (Rome) in the period from September to November 2006 in the frame of a programme started in 1994 for studying and monitoring the Estate's environment. The retrieval of information on the vertical profile of trace gases from their slant column amounts requires: (1) the simulation of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere for Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation; (2) the application of inversion schemes. In this paper the vertical profiles of NO 2 and O 3 obtained from multiple axis DOAS measurements and their daily evolution are presented and discussed. The day under study is the 29 th of October, 2006.},

abstract = {Optical remote sensing and iterative computed tomography (CT) can be applied to measure the spatial distribution of gaseous pollutant concentrations. We conducted chamber experiments to test this combination of techniques using an open path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR) and a standard algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Although ART converged to solutions that showed excellent agreement with the measured ray-integral concentrations, the solutions were inconsistent with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. A new CT method was developed that combines (1) the superposition of bivariate Gaussians to represent the concentration distribution and (2) a simulated annealing minimization routine to find the parameters of the Gaussian basis functions that result in the best fit to the ray-integral concentration data. This method, named smooth basis function minimization (SBFM), generated reconstructions that agreed well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the concentration profiles generated from point sampling. We present an analysis of two sets of experimental data that compares the performance of ART and SBFM. We conclude that SBFM is a superior CT reconstruction method for practical indoor and outdoor air monitoring applications.},

The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv.

The pro-cedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two-or three-dimensional trace gas distri-butions can be retrieved.

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {A new mathematical optimization method is presented for reconstructing pollution plume concentrations from tomographic remote sensing measurements on neighborhood scales (about 1 km ?? 1 km) using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). The new method, called CAT-4Dvar, combines Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) and 4D variational (4Dvar) data assimilation. The objective of the method is to produce accurate reconstructions compared to the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and other non-variational methods with only a small number of DOAS telescopes. A forward and adjoint 3D grid dispersion model was developed based on advection and diffusion solvers commonly used in air quality modeling. The adjoint model optimizes the model emissions and horizontal diffusion coefficient based on the difference between tomographic DOAS observations and ray path-integrated concentrations predicted by the forward model. It also updates the corresponding error covariances based on the Hessian of the cost function. An enhanced reconstruction is obtained from the forward model with optimized parameter values. In a synthetic experiment involving two hypothetical DOAS instruments, the CAT-4Dvar method yielded excellent results compared to ART, reducing the overall nearness index from 57{\%} to 11{\%}. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An entirely different approach for tomographic imaging consists of assuming that the cross section consists of an array of unknowns, and then setting up algebraic equations for the unknowns in terms of the measured projection data. Although conceptually this approach is much simpler than the transform-based methods discussed in previous sections, for medical applications it lacks the accuracy and the speed of implementation. However, there are situations where it is not possible to measure a large number of projections, or the projections are not uniformly distributed over 180 or 360”) both these conditions being necessary requirements for the transformbased techniques to produce results with the accuracy desired in medical imaging. An example of such a situation is earth resources imaging using cross-borehole measurements discussed in Chapter 4. Problems of this type are sometimes more amenable to solution by algebraic techniques. Algebraic techniques are also useful when the energy propagation paths between the source and receiver positions are subject to ray bending on account of refraction, or when the energy propagation undergoes attenuation along ray paths as in emission CT. [Unfortunately, many imaging problems where refraction is encountered also suffer from diffraction effects (see Chap. 4).] As will be obvious from the discussion to follow, in algebraic methods it is essential to know ray paths that connect the corresponding transmitter and receiver positions. When refraction and diffraction effects are substantial (medium inhomogeneities exceed 10{\%} of the average background value and the correlation length of these inhomogeneities is comparable to a wavelength), it becomes impossible to predict these ray paths. If algebraic techniques are applied under these conditions, we often obtain meaningless results.},

Accurate, long-term monitoring of these compounds at low part-per-billion levels, as well as identifying emission point sources is therefore crucial to protect human health in neighborhoods near large emission sources. Here we present a new long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) instrument specifically designed to monitor aromatic hydrocarbons. The system is based on a novel dual - light emitting diode (LED) light source, which eliminates the requirement to suppress spectrometer stray light. This light source, together with a high stability fiber-based sending/receiving telescope, allows the measurement of aromatic hydrocarbons on once-folded absorptions paths of 200–1200 m length. The new instrument shows very good agreement with simultaneous in-situ measurements if inhomogeneities of the trace gas spatial distributions are considered. The new instrument performed well during a three-month field test as an automated fence-line monitor at a refinery, successfully distinguishing upwind background levels of ∼1 ppb from emissions reflected in elevated mixing ratios of 3–4 ppb. A two-dimensional measurement network based on two identical LP-DOAS instruments operating on seven crossed light paths was operated successfully in Houston, TX. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of two events with toluene and xylene plumes demonstrate how this setup can be used to derive the spatial distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and identify point sources.},

abstract = {The Tomographic Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (Tom-DOAS) technique and results from a first application are presented. This novel technique serves to measure 2-3-dimensional concentration fields of different trace gases (e.g. NO 2, SO 2, ozone) in the planetary boundary layer on a small scale (100-10 000 m) by the use of multiple light paths. Ways to use telescopes, lamps, retroreflector arrays and spectrometers for the simultaneous measurement of many light-paths are proposed. The results from a first Long-path Tom-DOAS experiment next to a German motorway, which was part of the BAB II campaign April/May 2001 [Edition of the Institut f{\"{u}}r Meteorologie und Klimaforschung, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe/Universit{\"{a}}t Karlsruhe, pp. 45, 2001), are presented. From the measurements along 16 different light paths vertical profiles on both sides of the motorway as well as a two-dimensional map of the NO 2 vehicle emission plume are derived. The concentration distributions agree qualitatively with model simulations of an earlier campaign. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Though there are several existing techniques, it seems helpful to have a more automated method to remove the possible errors that hinder clearer image reconstruction. Here, we proposed an alternative method and new algorithm using the sinogram and the fixed point. A new physical concept of Center of Attenuation (CA) was also introduced to figure out how this fixed point is applied to the image reconstruction with errors we further categorized.

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO(2), HCHO, SO(2), H(2)O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In this study, we theoretically investigate the re-construction of 2-D cross sections through Gaussian concen-tration distributions, e.g. emission plumes, from long path DOAS measurements along a limited number of light paths. This is done systematically with respect to the extension of the up to four peaks and for six different measurement setups with 2–4 telescopes and 36 light paths each. We distinguish between cases with and without additional background con-centrations. Our approach parametrises the unknown distri-bution by local piecewise constant or linear functions on a regular grid and solves the resulting discrete, linear system by a least squares minimum norm principle. We show that the linear parametrisation not only allows better representa-tion of the distributions in terms of discretisation errors, but also better inversion of the system. We calculate area inte-grals of the concentration field (i.e. total emissions rates for non-vanishing perpendicular wind speed components) and show that reconstruction errors and reconstructed area inte-grals within the peaks for narrow distributions crucially de-pend on the resolution of the reconstruction grid. A recently suggested grid translation method for the piecewise con-stant basis functions, combining reconstructions from sev-eral shifted grids, is modified for the linear basis functions and proven to reduce overall reconstruction errors, but not the uncertainty of concentration integrals. We suggest a pro-cedure to subtract additional background concentration fields before inversion. We find large differences in reconstruction quality between the geometries and conclude that, in general, for a constant number of light paths increasing the number of telescopes leads to better reconstruction results. It ap-pears that geometries that give better results for negligible measurement errors and parts of the geometry that are better resolved are also less sensitive to increasing measurement er-rors.},

@article{Winklehner2011,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP). METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated. RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96{\%}) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p {\textless} 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4{\%} lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p {\textless} 0.05) and 30.8{\%} lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p {\textless} 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p {\textless} 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP. CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction {\textgreater}50{\%} while maintaining image quality. Key Points • Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection • At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours • In body CTA a dose reduction of {\textgreater}50{\%} might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.},

The approach combines path-integrated concentration data acquired with any path-integrated optical remote sensing (PI-ORS) technique and computed tomography (CT) technique. In this study, an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) instrument sampled path-integrated concentrations along five radial beam paths in a vertical plane downwind from the source. A meteorological station collected measurements of wind direction and wind speed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was released from a controlled area source simulator. The innovative CT technique, which applies the smooth basis function minimization method to the beam data in conjunction with measured wind data, was used to estimate the total flux from the simulated area source. The new approach estimates consistently underestimated the true emission rates in unstable atmospheric conditions and agreed with the true emission rate in neutral atmospheric conditions. This approach is applicable to many types of industrial areas or volume sources, given the use of an adequate PI-ORS system.},

The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv.

We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the "off-axis" methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new measurement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized.},

abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Numerical studies were performed to evaluate a new air monitoring method for reconstructing chemical exposures and source emissions, based upon optical remote sensing (ORS) and computed tomography (CT). With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized.},

@article{Kastis2012,
abstract = {An efficient, two-dimensional, analytic, Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) for SPECT has been presented earlier in the literature. The SRT is a reconstruction algorithm based on an analytic formula of the inverse Attenuated Radon Transform which results from the approximation of the sinogram in terms of cubic splines. The algorithm incorporates the attenuation map obtained by a CT scan, to provide attenuation corrected images. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SRT algorithm, using phantoms and real SPECT/CT data, by comparing it with two commonly used reconstruction algorithms: FBP and OSEM. The uniformity and resolution limitations of the analytic SRT algorithm is assessed in simulation studies by using a Uniformity phantom, a slice of the Hoffman brain phantom, and two slices of the NCAT human torso phantom. Appropriate attenuation maps are used for each image. Reconstructed images are obtained for 60, 90, 120, and 180 projections over 360 degrees. Furthermore, real SPECT sinograms and their corresponding CT images are acquired from a clinical SPECT/CT system, and then reconstructed employing the SRT algorithm. The reconstructed images obtained via the SRT algorithm are compared to those produced by FBP and OSEM. Several profiles are presented which illustrate the ability of SRT algorithm to correct for attenuation. The SRT reconstructions from clinical data are also compared with the OSEM reconstructions provided by the commercial system. Comparisons between fused images are also presented. Our preliminary results suggest that SRT appears to provide better reconstructed images than FBP at least for the cases when no attenuation correction is applied to FBP. The reconstruction time for SRT was about 2 sec which is comparable to that of FBP and faster than OSEM. Regarding reconstructions for the data obtained from the clinical system, SRT appears to provide comparable quality images with the OSEM reconstructions processed by the comme- cial system. However, further evaluation of SRT is needed to substantiate this claim. It is also important to note that SRT suffers from striking artifacts, due to angular under-sampling, which become worse at low number of projection angles.},

abstract = {We present a new computed tomography method, the low third derivative (LTD) method, that is particularly suited for reconstructing the spatial distribution of gas concentrations from path-integral data for a small number of optical paths. The method finds a spatial distribution of gas concentrations that (1) has path integrals that agree with measured path integrals, and (2) has a low third spatial derivative in each direction, at every point. The trade-off between (1) and (2) is controlled by an adjustable parameter, which can be set based on analysis of the path-integral data. The method produces a set of linear equations, which can be solved with a single matrix multiplication if the constraint that all concentrations must be positive is ignored; the method is therefore extremely rapid. Analysis of experimental data from thousands of concentration distributions shows that the method works nearly as well as smooth basis function minimization (the best method previously available), yet is about 100 times faster.

abstract = {Imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IDOAS) is an optical remote-sensing method using scattered sunlight as light source. It combines a "pushbroom" imaging spectrometer with the DOAS technique and thus allows imaging two-dimensional trace gas distributions, e.g., in volcanic plumes. The highly sensitive and specific detection of many trace gases simultaneously (specific molecules, not just elements, e.g. SO2, BrO, NO2, O3, HCHO, etc.) is possible, and the temporal and spatial variation of these gases can be measured. The IDOAS system presented here enables the taking of two-dimensional images of trace gas distributions in a volcanic plume with a spatial resolution of 100 pixels horizontally × 64 pixels vertically, each with a field of view of 0.087° in horizontal and 0.208° in vertical directions. Therefore, IDOAS provides useful information about the chemical composition and chemical variability in a volcanic plume and allows studying plume dispersal and chemical transformations. The technique was applied to map the SO2 distribution in the plume of Mt. Etna volcano for the first time in October 2003. {\textcopyright} 2005 N. Bobrowski. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Context: In recent years, many usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been employed to evaluate Web applications. However, many of these applications still do not meet most customers' usability expectations and many companies have folded as a result of not considering Web usability issues. No studies currently exist with regard to either the use of usability evaluation methods for the Web or the benefits they bring. Objective: The objective of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge that is available as regards the usability evaluation methods (UEMs) that have been employed to evaluate Web applications over the last 14 years. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to assess the UEMs that have been used by researchers to evaluate Web applications and their relation to the Web development process. Systematic mapping studies are useful for categorizing and summarizing the existing information concerning a research question in an unbiased manner. Results: The results show that around 39{\%} of the papers reviewed reported the use of evaluation methods that had been specifically crafted for the Web. The results also show that the type of method most widely used was that of User Testing. The results identify several research gaps, such as the fact that around 90{\%} of the studies applied evaluations during the implementation phase of the Web application development, which is the most costly phase in which to perform changes. A list of the UEMs that were found is also provided in order to guide novice usability practitioners. Conclusions: From an initial set of 2703 papers, a total of 206 research papers were selected for the mapping study. The results obtained allowed us to reach conclusions concerning the state-of-the-art of UEMs for evaluating Web applications. This allowed us to identify several research gaps, which subsequently provided us with a framework in which new research activities can be more appropriately positioned, and from which useful information for novice usability practitioners can be extracted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We present experiments in which one time-varying and 11 different steady-state tracer-gas concentration profiles were generated in a ventilated chamber and sampled in a horizontal plane by an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometer for subsequent CT inversion. CT reconstructions were performed using the recently developed smooth basis function minimization (SBFM) technique. The CT reconstructions were compared with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. Agreement between the two sampling methods was qualitatively very good, with concentration profiles generated by both methods showing the same features of peak location and shape. Quantitative agreement was generally good to within 50{\%}. We discuss the sources of discrepancy and suggest directions for future research, especially with regard to monitoring time-dependent processes. With further refinements in the SBFM algorithm and improvements in optical remote sensing hardware, this technique promises to yield rapid and accurate measurements of the spatial distribution of gases in indoor environments.},

abstract = {Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques (ART) were introduced by Gordon, Bender {\&} Herman (1970) for solving the problem of three dimensional reconstruction from projections in electron microscopy and radiology. This is a deconvolution problem of a particular type: an estimate of a function in a higher dimensional space is deconvolved from its experimentally measured projections to a lower dimensional space. For instance, an x-ray photograph represents the projection of the three-dimensional distribution of x-ray densities within the body onto a two-dimensional plane. A finite number of such photographs taken at different angles allows us to reconstruct an estimate of the original 3-D densities. (Density refers to optical density.) The ART algorithms for solving this problem have a simple intuitive basis. Each projected density is thrown back across the higher dimensional region from whence it came, with repeated corrections to bring each projection of the estimate into agreement with the corresponding measured projection. In order to discuss the ART algorithms, one must first carefully consider the representation of space in digital computers (Sections II and III). Subsequent sections will survey the original ART algorithm (Section IV), convergence criteria (Section V), variations on the ART algorithm (Section VI), reliability of reconstructions (Section VII) and computing efficiency (Section VIII).

As in most algebraic schemes, the region to be reconstructed is divided into small pixels. For each pixel a concentration or attenuation coefficient must be estimated. In the maximum likelihood approach these parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood (probability of the observations). EM algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all EM algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the EM algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates. We discuss the specification of necessary physical features such as source and detector geometries. Actual reconstructions are deferred to a later time.},

We propose some innovative solutions in the field of DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote systems, utilizing diffuse so- lar light as the radiation source. We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the «off-axis» methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new meas- urement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

abstract = {The easyPET scanner has an innovative design, comprising only two array columns facing each other, and with an actuation defined by two rotation axes. Using this design, two approaches have been taken. The first concerns to a didactic PET scanner, where the arrays of detectors are comprised of only one detector each, and it is meant to be a simple 2-dimensional PET scanner for educational purposes. The second corresponds to a pre-clinical scanner, with the arrays having multiple detectors, meant to acquire 3-dimensional data. Given the geometry of the system, there is no concern with the effects of not measuring the Depth-of-Interaction (DOI), and a resolution of 1-1.5 mm is expected with the didactic system, improving with the pre-clinical. The work presented in this thesis deals with 2D image reconstruction for the easyPET scanners. The unconventional nature of the acquisition geometry, the large amount of data to be processed, the complexity of implementing a PET image reconstruction algorithm, and the implementation of data regularization methods, gaussian filtering and Median Root Prior (MRP), were addressed in this thesis. For this, the Matlab software was used to implement the ML-EM algorithm. Alongside, several optimizations were also implemented in order to convey a better computational performance to the algorithm. These optimizations refer to using geometry symmetries and fast indexing approaches. Moreover, a user interface was created so as to enhance the user experience for the didactic easyPET system. The validation of the implemented algorithm was performed using Monte Carlo simulated, and acquired data. The first results obtained indicate that the optimizations implemented on the algorithm have successfully reduced the image reconstruction time. On top of that, the system was tested according to the NEMA rules. A comparison was then made between reconstructed images produced by using Filtered Back Projection (FBP), the native ML-EM implementation, the ML-EM algorithm using inter- iteration gaussian filtering, and the ML-EM algorithm implemented with the MRP. This comparison was made through the calculation of FWHM, FWTM, and SNR, at different spatial positions. The results obtained reveal an approximate 1.5x 1.5 mm2 FWHM source resolution in the FOV, when recurring to FBP, and 1.2x 1.2 mm2 for the native ML-EM algorithm. The implemented data regularization methods produced similar or improved spatial resolution results, whilst improving the source's SNR values. The results obtained show the potential in the easyPET systems. Since the didactic scanner is already on its final stage, the next step will be to further test the pre-clinical system},

@article{Montagud2012,
abstract = {It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e.g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92{\%} of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67{\%} of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56{\%} are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25{\%} of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines.},

abstract = {Some properties of the algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) for reconstructing objects from their projections (e.g. electron micrographs) are discussed. Some generalizations of previously published ART algorithms are given. In particular, ART is extended to handle weighted projection data. An early conjecture about ART is proved for one of the algorithms: it converges to the most uniform solution of the constraint equations provided by the projection data. Other convergence properties of the ART algorithms are discussed and proved. Some new ART algorithms are described. These are believed to converge to optimal reconstructions consistent with the projection data. The importance of choosing the correct ray widths in case of real projection data is demonstrated, and a method for calculating correct ray widths is given. A method is proposed for estimating the optimal number of iterations in a reconstruction. The performance of ART on real data is demonstrated both in the absence of and in the presence of noise. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {—A full computer-controlled multiple light paths differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) apparatus are applied for air pollution monitoring in the suburb of NanJing. Two optical paths have been installed in the DOAS system (OPSIS AB, Sweden), which is operating since September 2007, and both are controlled with the same main unit, and so only one analyzer system studies the light received. A beam-finding servosystem and automatic gain control permit unattended long-time monitoring. The concentrations and standard deviations of a wide number of pollutants, along with light levels in the system are stored in the central unit computer. Being able to monitor a range of user-specified compounds continuously in real time with a single system, the OPSIS instruments offer high levels of accuracy, reliability and data capture. The first results obtained with the DOAS system are presented in this work; comparisons between pollutant data obtained along the two optical paths (and relations between different pollutant concentrations) have been carried out.},

DOAS tomography is a new technique to determine 2-and 3-dimensional concentration fields of air pollutants or other trace gases by combining dif-ferential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) with tomo-graphic inversion techniques. Due to the limited amount of measured data, the resulting concentration fields are sensitive to the inversion process. Therefore detailed error estimations are needed to determine the quality of the reconstruction. In this paper we compare different row acting methods for the inversion, present a procedure for optimizing the parameters of the reconstruction process and propose a way to estimate the error-fields by numerical studies. The procedure was ap-plied to data from the motorway emission campaign BAB II. Two dimensional NO 2 cross sections at right angles to the motorway could be reconstructed qualitatively well at differ-ent meteorological situations. Additionally we present error fields for the reconstructions which show the problems and skills of the used measurement setup. Numerical studies on an improved setup for future motorway campaigns show, that DOAS tomography is able to produce high quality concentra-tion maps.},

abstract = {Tomographic Target Light scattering – Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (ToTaL-DOAS), also called Target-DOAS, is a novel experimental procedure to retrieve trace gas concentrations present in the low atmosphere. Scattered sunlight (partially or totally) reflected from natural or artificial targets of similar albedo located at different 5 distances is analyzed to retrieve the concentration of different trace gases like NO 2 , SO 2 and others. We report high spatial resolution measurements of NO 2 mixing ratios in the city of Montevideo (Uruguay) observing three buildings as targets with a Mini-DOAS instrument. Our instrument was 146 m apart from the first building, 196 m from the second and 286 m from the third one. All three buildings are located along a main 10 Avenue. We obtain temporal variation of NO 2 mixing ratios between 30 ppb and 65 ppb (±2 ppb). Our measurements demonstrate that ToTaL-DOAS measurements can be made over very short distances. In polluted air masses, the retrieved absorption signal was found to be strong enough to allow measurements over distances in the range of several ten meters, and achieve a spatial resolution of 50 m approximately.},

abstract = {– An overview is given on the novel DOAS Tomography technique, its capabilities and the measurements and simulations performed so far. With this technique, column densities of one or several trace gases are measured by DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) along multiple (10-400) light paths, and reconstructed to concentration distributions by tomographic inversion. In the framework of the German BMBF project " Tom-DOAS " and the European project " Format " , tomographic measurements have been conducted from the ground using Multibeam Longpath DOAS instruments and from aircraft using an AMAX (Airborne Multi AXis) DOAS instrument.},

A configuration of three Multibeam Long path DOAS Instruments and almost 20 different light paths to retro reflector arrays will be used in spring 2005 for 2D measurements of NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , HCHO, and HONO over an area of a few square km above the city center of Heidelberg. With each of the telescopes it is possible to measure along up to six light paths at once. Later measurements at shorter wavelength will be performed to investigate the concentrations of the aromatic compounds Benzene, Toluene and X-Phenol. The 2D trace gas distributions will be obtained using reconstruction techniques.},

@article{Frins2006a,
abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy ͑MAX-DOAS͒ is proposed. The pro-cedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two-or three-dimensional trace gas distri-butions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measure-ments taken across the city of Heidelberg.},
